	<h2>PodofoImpose</h2>
	<div>PodofoImpose is a utility program which aims to provide a rather simple way to impose PDF documents. Originally written for my own use, it ended up in PoDoFo release as a show-case (don’t rely too much on it).</div>
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<div> PodofoImpose is driven by a PLAN file. This file describes how pages from a source PDF document have to be relayout into a target document. We’ll describe how this file must be formated. <dl>
		<dt>Header</dt>
		<dd>The first line of the file indicates the width and height of the target document without its trim box.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Records</dt>
		<dd>Each line of the file is a record describing how a page from the source page will be repositionned. Each line is of the form: <pre>source_page target_page rotation translationX translationY</pre>
	</dd>
	</dl> Once you’ve wrote the PLAN file you can run the program: <pre>$podofoimpose source.pdf target.pdf plan.plan 0</pre>
		
		<pre>Note1: the source can be either a PDF file or a text file which is a listing of PDF files</pre>
		<pre>Note2: the last argument is the external margin that you can ask PodofoImpose to insert;
			in this case it will create a trimbox, print cut marks and the folio </pre>
		
        </div>
	
	<h3>Examples</h3>
	<h5>Add a stamp to a document</h5>
	<p>
	<p>Shame on me, don’t even have a real stamp at my "office". So I tried something and it worked! Say you have that official one page A4 doc on which you want to add a nice stamp named official.pdf. You have your stamp in the file stamp.pdf. You first have to create two files : <pre>
		== pdf.list ==
		official.pdf
		stamp.pdf
		=========
	</pre>
		<pre>
		==stamponator.plan==
		597.6 842.4
		1 1 0 0 0
		2 1 0 350 100
		===============
	</pre> Now you can run:
	<pre>$podofoimpose  pdf.list stamped-official.pdf stamponator.plan 0</pre>
	</p>
	
	
		<h5>Make a tiled poster</h5>
		<p>
			I composed a 640x380 mm document in Scribus, I was thinking I could use the 
			built-in Kprinter poster option to print it on my A4 laser printer. But no 
			poster available on my OpenSuse box, so I thought I could give podofo a try.
			Here is the plan file, it’s still not exact but since i get my poster printed 
			I don’t bother too much :)

<pre>
	==poster.plan======

	1 2 0 -547.92 172.4

I ran a regular:

	<h5>Multiple business cards on a sheet</h5>

	<pre>$podofoimpose carte.pdf carte_imposed.pdf carte.plan 38.439</pre>
	Note the sheet margin adjustment which lets room for the cut marks (if there 
	is a relevant trim box in the file), I can’t decide if it’s a bug or a 
	feature! If the plan was generated automatically by a GUI app or something 
	similar it would be a feature but when you have to compute it "by hand", it’s 
a real pain. Although it gives good results.
